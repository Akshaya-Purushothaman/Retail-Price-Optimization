This project aims to optimize retail pricing strategies using various data analysis techniques and visualizations. We explore different factors such as unit prices, total prices, competitors' pricing, and customer behavior to gain insights and recommendations for price optimization. Additionally, we utilize Random Forest Regression to predict future prices based on historical data.
